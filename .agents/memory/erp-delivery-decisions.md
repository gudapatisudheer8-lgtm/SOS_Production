description: Financial integrity and private files on the existing AWS deployment.

Keep cleared financial postings immutable, balanced and transactionally saved; corrections are new entries.
**Why:** the original prototype updated browser balances and trusted approval-name strings, which are unsafe as authoritative financial records.
**How to apply:** preserve independent approval identities, project/firm checks, request idempotency and explicit account selection when extending source workflows.

Use a private single-instance EC2 attachment adapter for the current AWS release.
**Why:** the existing deployment is user-operated EC2/RDS; Replit-only storage does not automatically follow it.
**How to apply:** back up file bytes and database metadata together; recommend private S3 before multi-instance or automatic instance replacement.

Keep disposable preview databases in ignored persistent local state and check actual listener readiness.
**Why:** workspace restarts remove temporary files/processes; a stale postmaster PID can outlive its database process.
**How to apply:** explicitly enable localhost-only development fixtures and never seed the customer's RDS.
